## Delivery Notes

### Framing

#### Authentication vs Authorization

##### Authentication
- identification (R)

##### Authorization
- access control
- ownership (C U D)

### Curl requests
- is curl a client?
- is ajax a client?
- what is the api? (server)
- what language is curl? (NOT JS)
- what language is ajax (JS)
- what language is the server? (doesn't matter - we are working with the client)

#### Curl HEADER
- response header
- request header

### API
- what does the I stand for?
  - interface: something goes in, something comes out
- server is a black box. Don't worry about the server in the game project...just read the documentation
- the documentation provides the _contract_ that explains what will happen when a request comes in, and something comes out
- read the docs != you are an idiot. It means, the explanation for how it works is there, and that's the authoritative source.
